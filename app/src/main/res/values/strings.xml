    <string name="about_text">Blinkr allows anyone to connect and message drivers around them using only the drivers license plate number.\n\n

It acts like a bulletin board for your area by showing the most recent messages from people around you to drivers around you.\n\n

Post messages to help drivers, ask questions, or just speak your mind and hopefully make new friends. To post a message, you simply enter the license plate number and you are
ready to go.\n\n
